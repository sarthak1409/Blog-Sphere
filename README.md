# Blog-Sphere
BlogSphere is a minimalistic web application where users can share their profile details, including name, caption, followers, hobbies, and qualifications. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and powered by Node.js, EJS, and MySQL on the backend, it features a secure sign-up and sign-in system requiring login on every visit. The project emphasizes database-driven user management without blockchain integration, making it a straightforward yet effective platform for user interaction.
